# Protocol for the Meditation and Stress User-experience Survey
## a non-controlled trial measuring perceived stress in a simple meditation technique.

Chronic stress may be one of the risk factors for dementia[1][2]

While older people in the UK attempting to prevent dementia are encouraged to practise lifestyle techniques to "bust stress" [3], those in the US and Australia are often encouraged to use relaxation techniques usually starting with yoga and meditation[2,4,5].

In my work I have met older Christian people culturally and religiously uncomfortable with these techniques. I have developed a simple “meditating with Jesus” technique (MJT) that may be used as an alternative to other relaxation techniques in older people.

The changes in perceived stress as people commence MJT will be assessed using the 10-question Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [6,7].

Frequency of practice of MJT is self-reported on an online 0-4 Likert scale attached to the PSS form in answer to the question, “In the last month, how often did you use the “Meditating with Jesus” technique?” Scored according to number selected. The question is intentionally the same format as the those of the PSS[6,7].

Spiritual effectiveness is self-reported on an online 4-question, 0-4 Likert scale, scored according to number selected, attached to the PSS form in answer to the questions, 
* “In the last month, how often did you see God’s beauty and rejoice in His goodness?”
* “In the last month, how often did your heart glow with a sense of His love?”
* “In the last month, how often did you feel uplifted as if by everlasting arms?”
* “In the last month, how often did you comprehend more and accomplish more than you ever before deemed possible?” 


Reporting of feedback and side-effects is requested at the end of the one-month and six-month PSS

The primary aims of this study are to investigate    
    1. if there is any change in stress levels reported before and after MJT in people over 55 years of age.  
    2. if frequency of practise of MJT has an effect on stress levels and spirituality reported. 

Secondary objectives are to assess if age, gender, locality or Christian belief have any effect on the effectiveness of the treatment.

No ethics approvals were sought or obtained. Participants may opt out at any time and the program was fully explained in writing and on video.

**Health Condition:** Perceived stress

**Study Type:** Interventional, open

**Intervention:** Meditating with Jesus.   
Contemplation of a gospel story of Jesus Christ helping people, then applying the characteristics he displayed to the problems and worries of the participant. Morning and evening, daily.

Adherence will be encouraged by providing an option for daily emails with suitable Gospel readings when the participant subscribes.

The MJT will be taught online immediately after the participant registers. 

**Intervention Code:** Behavioural

**Comparator:** No control group

**Purpose of the study:** Treatment

 ##  Primary Outcomes, Timepoints and Statistical Methods  
**Type of Endpoint:** Efficacy

### Primary Outcome 1   
The change in perceived stress level as reported on the PSS

#### Timepoint 1   
The PSS will be administered online via a Google Form at recruitment (baseline), at one month later and six months after baseline.

#### Statistical Method 1   
Within factor ANOVA of change, PSS (one month) - PSS (baseline),  and PSS (six months) - PSS (one month) with a < 0.01 and a 95% confidence interval. Effect size will be calculated using Cohens d.

### Primary Outcome 2   
The relationship of frequency of practice of MJT to the change in perceived stress level.

#### Timepoint 2    
Frequency of practise as reported on an online Likert scale with the PSS at one month and six months after learning MJT. 

#### Statistical Method 2    
Between factor repeated measures ANOVA

### Primary Outcome 3    
The relationship of frequency of practice of MJT to the level of spiritual effectiveness.

#### Timepoint 3    
Frequency of practise and the level of spiritual effectiveness are reported on an online 4-question Likert scale with the PSS at one month and six months after learning MJT.

#### Statistical Method 3    
Between factor repeated measures ANOVA

 ## Secondary Outcomes, Timepoints and Statistical Methods 
### Secondary Outcome 1   
Improvement in perceived stress scores, PSS (one month) - PSS (baseline),  and PSS (six months) - PSS (one month) compared to gender

Change in PSS at one month and six months

#### Statistical Method 2   
Between factor repeated measures ANOVA

### Secondary Outcome 3   
Improvement in perceived stress scores compared to location (Continent the participant is resident in). 

#### Timepoint 3   
Change in PSS at one month and six months

#### Statistical Method 3  
Between factor repeated measures ANOVA 

### Secondary Outcome 4  
Improvement in perceived stress scores compared to belief status (Believer in Jesus, non-believer, previous believer, prefer not to say). 

#### Timepoint 4  
Change in PSS at one month and six months

#### Statistical Method 4  
Between factor repeated measures ANOVA

### Secondary Outcome 5  
Improvement in perceived stress scores compared to reported spiritual effectiveness

#### Timepoint 5  
Change in PSS and reported spiritual effectiveness at one month and six months

#### Statistical Method 5  
Between factor repeated measures ANOVA 

### Secondary Outcome 6  
All feedback will be reported verbatum and side-effects reported and counted.

#### Timepoint 6  
Change in PSS and reported spiritual effectiveness at one month and six months

#### Statistical Method 6  
Counting positive and negative feedback and side-effects.
